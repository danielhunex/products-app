The instruction does not mention what the second button should be in the Action column, so I assumed Delete button. In addtion, the data has a duplicate sku and I had to change the duplicated sku.

The app uses Tailwindcss, DaisyUI, React-Icons, NextJs, and Json-Server

Future Work: Pagination, Making it eye-candy, unit tests, e2e tests

In order to run the app, do
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
